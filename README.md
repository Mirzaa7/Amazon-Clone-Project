# Amazon-Clone-Project

This is a Full-stack Amazon Clone Project built using React JS. It has functionalities like: 

- Authentication
  Where a user can create or log in to an account, which is implemented through Firebase. 

- Add to basket and remove from basket
  Which are implemented using the React Context API. The basket items are rendered on different pages.

- Order proccessing
  When a user proceeds to the checkout, where they enter the relevant information(which are not usable because this is a Amazon Clone and there is no real payment proccessing) and order their products, the orders for each user account are stored in a Firebase database, which are rendered in the Returns & Orders page.
